## Required
* PHP >= v.8.0 
* Composer >= v.2.4
* We suggest you visit Laravel's official website

#### GD - PHP extension for photo manipulation
In this project are used packages for dynamically manipulating the attached photos, so it is possible that an error may appear if your "php.ini" file is not configured correctly. By default, this file disables certain extensions and these packages (dependencies) that we used in the project. All you need is:
<br>
->  Open your "php.ini" file as a text document (using Notepad or other similar software)
<br>
->  Find the line `;extension=gd` and change it to `extension=gd`
<br>
->  Restart your apache server
> If you don't know how to find the "php.ini" file... the most common path is `C:\php`. You can also type the command: `php --ini' in the command prompt to get more information

#### Possible error: 
-> "Unsupported cipher or incorrect key length. Supported ciphers are..."
<br>
It is a wrong generated APP_KEY ie. an application encryption key. Open the ".env" file located at the root of the project. Delete the entered value and run the command:
> php artisan key:generate

-> "SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it"
<br>
You may not have started your local server. Depending on which software you are using as a server package, start it as well as the Apache server and try again. Known softwares: WAMP, XAMPP, ampss, and so on.

#### Possible error:
-> "Could not find driver (SQL: SHOW FULL TABLES WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE').."
<br>
The error message "Could not find driver" usually indicates that the PHP extension for the database driver you are using is not installed or enabled on your system.
Open the "php.ini" file in a text editor and look for the line that starts with "extension=". Remove the semicolon (;) at the beginning of the line and replace <extension-name> with the name of the PHP extension you installed in step 2.
> extension=mysql

## Installation
* Clone this repository using this command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com-tim4-22/library.git
 ```
* Enter the root folder if you are not already there

* Install/update composer packages:
```shell
composer install | composer update
```
* Copy .env.example file to the .env file and configure the variables according to your environment
* You can do this with the following command:
```shell
cp .env.example .env
```
* Since this application uses Algolia for searching, you will need to ask the administrator for the keys of the following variables:
```shell
SCOUT_DRIVER | SCOUT_QUEUE | ALGOLIA_APP_ID | ALGOLIA_SECRET
```
* Also, since this app uses Laravel Socialite for registration/log in using a third-party app/platform like Google, GitHub, etc. you will need to ask the administrator for the keys of the following variants:
```shell
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID | GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET | GITHUB_REDIRECT_URL
```

* If you want to integrate the newsletter, you can define your own values ​​for the specified variables:
```shell
MAILCHIMP_APIKEY | MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID
```
We use a newsletter mail service: Mailchimp

* If you want to visit your local database in a fast, efficient, and modern way, you can easily do it with the admin that we have integrated together with the application. You can visit the Admin UI by going to:
```shell
{{base_url}}/adminer
```
We use the theme: Hydra Dark

* Generate encryption key:
```shell
php artisan key:generate
``` 
* Run migrations:
```shell
php artisan migrate 
```
* If your database is already filled use this command:
```shell
php artisan migrate:fresh
```     
* For testing purposes, you can use Laravel's already built-in server with the command:
```shell
php artisan serve
```

After executing all the above commands, you should run the application and see it at http::/localhost of your domain depending on your configuration.

> Note 1.1: If you want to write/execute already existing tests, be sure to change the env variable: APP_ENV=local -> APP_ENV=testing

> Note 1.2: If you want to back up your database, do so using the integrated package command:
```shell
php artisan backup:run
```

> Action - the book write-off operation is available only if the book is overdrawn

## Reservations - statuses
> Reservations have 5 statuses:
- Accepted
- Rejected
- On hold
- Archived
- Expired
## Sessions - flash messages - statuses
- Info
- Successfully
- Failed

## Protection and security
- Middleware protection on all routes (web and API)
- CSRF token - protection
- Used policies
- Password hashing - bcrypt
- Protection on three levels.. by roles -> administrator, librarian, and student
- Honeypot 
- XSS protection

## Cron jobs - scheduled tasks
> There are 3 tasks:
- The first task that is executed on a daily basis and that automatically archives active expired reservations
- Another task that is executed on a monthly basis and automatically deletes users who have not logged in for more than 365 days
- The third task is executed twice a day and automatically changes the status of the library in terms of work. When the library is closed, the status is '0', and when it is open, it is '1'. With defined working hours, start and end in hours, this task executes in those times and changes the status

## Shutdown mode
> The administrator can "send" the application to the so-called "shutdown" mode. Laravel has a built-in "php artisan down" command that "shuts down" the application.
Our application work using the web route "/shutdown" which is protected.

### Steps:
1. When you want to shut down the application -> Go to URL "{{base_url}}/shutdown" ! note: you must be logged in and be an "administrator"
2. When you want to start the application -> Go to the URL "{{base_url}}/live.php" after which a "redirect" page will appear
